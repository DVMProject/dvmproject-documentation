DVM TEAM,

Need to update the main docs site? Pull from the `source-md` branch (this one), then make changes locally. 

Once ready to deploy to live (main branch), commit your source md files to `source-md` then run `mkdocs gh-deploy` locally. That should output the raw site which then you push to `gh-pages`.

If you have any questions, hit up Dev_Ranger#0001 :)
